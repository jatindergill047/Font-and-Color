            <p>I’m not bragging, but I’ve got a submission that’s going to Blow. Your. Mind. You’re going to fall in love with this story so hard you won’t care that it doesn’t even come close to meeting the submission guidelines of your fine internet journal. By the way, I know you say you don’t want attachments, but this story has too many spacing and formatting requirements to paste in the body of an email, so I attached it.</p>
            <p>I get it. You have to have rules to keep the weirdos at bay, but come on, rules are for pussies. I’m not a pussy. You’re not a pussy, are you? You don’t want to go down in literary history as the giant pussy who had a chance to publish my masterpiece and passed on it because he’s a fucking pussy, do you?</p>
            <p>Let’s face it, opportunities like this one don’t come along every day. I’m about to be a big deal. Even with all your very specific quote-unquote submission guidelines, you’re still overwhelmed on the daily with trash. Honestly, most of the stories that actually make it out of your slush pile are still trash, but your site is super popular so I’m giving you this chance anyway.</p>
            <p>With all that said, I am submitting, for your edification and enjoyment, but also with full faith that you'll have the good sense to accept and publish it, a rather longish short story called “A.I., Captain.” I know my story is not technically appropriate for your publication, but I really want to be published on your highly trafficked website, and I think once you read all nine-thousand four-hundred thirty-seven words of my story you'll be grateful that I brazenly ignored your carefully crafted submission guidelines.</p>
