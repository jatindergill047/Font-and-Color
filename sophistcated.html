        <p>Every 9/11 I reflect. Today I was thinking about the collective mind of the nation.
            It’s been seventeen years since the incident, and the psychosis of modern life 
            in America is an attestation of the hidden pain and trauma ingrained in the 
            contemporary American animus. Everyday there is a mass shooting, suicide rates
            are at an all time high, US citizens are over-medicating pain and depression,
            and prospects just seem dimmer and dimmer as retribution politics play out on 
            the world stage. As of today, the United States uses a few coping mechanisms 
            to work through the pain of the incident that occurred on September 11, 2001.
            These coping mechanisms include memes, ritualistic (yet void) “thoughts and prayers” 
            types of televised memorials, and empty symbolic propaganda. Each one serves a 
            purpose for individuals as well as the collective.</p>
        <p>Memes are a popular form of communication. Memes are pictures with captions, used to 
            quickly display wit and references. In context to September 11th, memes serve as a 
            coping mechanism, as humor masks pain. Currently 9/11 is seen as a day for “meme farmers”
            to share their works across all of the social networks. The memes are crass, ironic, 
            nihilistic, self-referential, meta, political, and always integrating the newest ideas.
            These pixaled jokes are the memetic representation of the trauma that surrounds this
            incident. Memes, while expressing irony and nihilism also express a kind of hopelessness
            surrounding 9/11. As funny as the memes are, there is always a sadness that shadows the
            humor. This is the trauma.
            Next, the void yet reflective pomp and circumstance of the yearly ritual remembrance of
            those who were lost. These have been reduced to televised symbol worship and “thoughts 
            and prayers” type of reflexive, vacant memorials. A flag waves, the soldier plays taps
            at 10:28 am, a moment of silence, and the world moves on. But America doesn’t. These memorials,
            while helpful for the families affected by the tragedy, are not helpful for the collective 
            mental state of the US. These memorial ceremonies are typically accompanied by archival 
            (yet censored and edited) live footage of the event. This rips open old wounds, and pours 
            salt on that unhealed emotional trauma. One good aspect of these is that those watching typically 
            reminisce with people they are around. Same on the social networks. Someone always asks “Where were
            you?” or, “What memory do you have of the day?”. Most share some detail of seeing the towers fall,
            a feeling, a flash. Over time, memories change, details blur. Yet the trauma remains.</p>
        <p>Unlike people born before 2001, people born after the date don’t have the memories to recall 
            what happened on that day and shortly thereafter. The young people are left with a paragraph
            or a blurb in scantly detailed history books that have been as sanitized as the footage of the
            jumpers from both buildings. People argue its better that the young people don’t know. I disagree, 
            because when this incident occurred, I was young. I had just graduated high school. No one told me
            that history would be sanitized to fit the current popular narrative. Because of my lack of knowledge
            of how governments take advantage of events like 9/11, and the lack of knowledge of so many young 
            people, Americans rights got systematically stripped in the name of security. The only way this can 
            be told, because the schoolbooks are obviously inadequate, is to teach them. I was reading an article 
            today about the events that conspired. This particular article was a difficult read, as it detailed 
            who the jumpers were and the feelings and thoughts of the families as well as postulation as to what
            would compel so many people to leap to their fates, to the pavement below. This article, “The Falling Man”,
            by Tom Junod, articulated how the US has self censored the pictures and videos of the jumpers, relegating
            the footage to the darkest corners of the internet. So obscured are the images and videos that these days 
            the unedited footage can only be found on such backwater torture porn sites such as Rotten.com, and the
            NY coroners office archives. The following quote reveals the mentality behind this self censorship:</p>
        <p>In conclusion, In order to be whole, according to Carl Jung's Anima/Aenimus archetype theory, one must fully 
            reconcile with all the aspects of the self. In Jung's example, the archetypes use the male/female polarities to 
            transcend the human individual psyche. These polar opposites are usually used to represent “light work”, 
            and “shadow work”. Shadow work is the deep exploration of all of dark, taboo otherwise shunned aspects of 
            the human mind. This includes the murky waters of our deepest fears and shame.
            If America can’t even talk about 9/11 outside of the censored parameters of patriotism and remembrance, 
            it leaves no room for the nation to discuss all of the aspects, including the dark depression that gripped 
            the nation shortly after, the mountainous amounts of death and the other shadow aspects. If America does not 
            heal its collective consciousness, the consequences of the trauma will carry on in the consequences we are 
            witnessing today. Endless war, depression, suicide, addiction. America needs to do its shadow work, and 
            reconcile the aspects of itself that it fears the most.</p>
