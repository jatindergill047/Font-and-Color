            <p>Every 9/11 I reflect. Today I was thinking about the collective mind of the nation.
                It’s been seventeen years since the incident, and the psychosis of modern life 
                in America is an attestation of the hidden pain and trauma ingrained in the 
                contemporary American animus. Everyday there is a mass shooting, suicide rates
                are at an all time high, US citizens are over-medicating pain and depression,
                and prospects just seem dimmer and dimmer as retribution politics play out on 
                the world stage. As of today, the United States uses a few coping mechanisms 
                to work through the pain of the incident that occurred on September 11, 2001.
                These coping mechanisms include memes, ritualistic (yet void) “thoughts and prayers” 
                types of televised memorials, and empty symbolic propaganda. Each one serves a 
                purpose for individuals as well as the collective.</p>
            <p>Memes are a popular form of communication. Memes are pictures with captions, used to 
                quickly display wit and references. In context to September 11th, memes serve as a 
                coping mechanism, as humor masks pain. Currently 9/11 is seen as a day for “meme farmers”
                to share their works across all of the social networks. The memes are crass, ironic, 
                nihilistic, self-referential, meta, political, and always integrating the newest ideas.
                These pixaled jokes are the memetic representation of the trauma that surrounds this
                incident. Memes, while expressing irony and nihilism also express a kind of hopelessness
                surrounding 9/11. As funny as the memes are, there is always a sadness that shadows the
                humor. This is the trauma.
                <p>In conclusion, In order to be whole, according to Carl Jung's Anima/Aenimus archetype theory, one must fully 
                reconcile with all the aspects of the self. In Jung's example, the archetypes use the male/female polarities to 
                transcend the human individual psyche. These polar opposites are usually used to represent “light work”, 
                and “shadow work”. Shadow work is the deep exploration of all of dark, taboo otherwise shunned aspects of 
                the human mind. This includes the murky waters of our deepest fears and shame.
                If America can’t even talk about 9/11 outside of the censored parameters of patriotism and remembrance, 
                it leaves no room for the nation to discuss all of the aspects, including the dark depression that gripped 
                the nation shortly after, the mountainous amounts of death and the other shadow aspects. If America does not 
                heal its collective consciousness, the consequences of the trauma will carry on in the consequences we are 
                witnessing today. Endless war, depression, suicide, addiction. America needs to do its shadow work, and 
                reconcile the aspects of itself that it fears the most.</p>
